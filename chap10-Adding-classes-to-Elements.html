        <!--In this example, we have some CSS speciﬁed in the style tag. 
            Elements with the hide class have a display : none style, meaning they are hidden. 
            Elements with the square class are 100 by 100 pixels and are yellow. 
            But when they have both the square and blue class, they are blue.
            When we click on the Disappear! button, the disappear() function gets called. 
            This one is speciﬁed in the script tag. 
            The disappear() function changes the classes by getting the classList property of the element with the ID shape , 
            which is the square we are seeing. 
            We are adding the hide class to the classList and because of this, the elements get the display: none layout 
            and we can no longer see it

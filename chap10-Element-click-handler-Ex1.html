    <!--HTML elements can do something when they are clicked. 
        This is because a JavaScript function can be connected to an HTML element. 
        Below is one snippet in which the JavaScript function associated with the element is speciﬁed in the HTML-->
    
    <div id="one" onclick="alert('Ouch! Stop it!')"> 
    Don't click Here!
    </div>

    <!--Whenever the text in the div gets clicked, a pop up with the text Ouch! Stop it! opens. 
        Here, the JavaScript is speciﬁed directly after onclick -->
